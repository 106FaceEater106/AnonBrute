# AnonBrute
Anonfiles scraper using their built-in API. Built for educational purposes as an example on cURL and Authentication mechanisms.

### Why?
I got bored.

### Does this work?
The chance of you ever finding anything is miniscule. I'd say you probably have a higher chance of winning the lottery.
But, that isn't the point of this program. The point of this program is to demonstrate how cURL in C++ can be implemented easily.

### Is this API abuse?
I'm pretty sure it isn't. It uses the anonfiles API in the way that it is intended to be used.
If that is not the case, and any anonfiles devs are viewing this, please let me know.
